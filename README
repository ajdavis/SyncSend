== Goals, highest- to lowest-priority ==

Power a commercial website that enables people to easily transfer files. Both
users visit the site roughly simultaneously, enter a unique key (e.g., the
sender's email address), and the file is transferred without any server-side
storage.

Implement Twisted classes for streaming HTTP requests that are generally useful
to Twisted developers.

Learn some cool technologies (Twisted, Socket.io).

Demonstrate skill to potential employers.
